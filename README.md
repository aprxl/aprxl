## About me

Hi, my name is April and I am a Brazilian 18 year old junior, self-taught developer. I am currently a Software Engineering major at [Universidade de Bras√≠lia](https://www.unb.br).

My main language is Typescript/Javascript (_node.js_) and I'm currently focusing in developing my web development skills with **React** and learning other JS frameworks such as Vue and Angular.

I like to direct my work towards helping other developers and to provide well-documented, open-source code for other users so I can not only improve my own work but also help others learn.

## My system

I'm currently running Windows 11 w/ an optional ArchLinux dual boot on both my systems. I use the _Windows Terminal_ with a custom _Powershell_ installation that I spend most of my day on.

My main code editor is _Visual Studio Code_ with _VIM_ keybinds for better productivity, although I've been considering fully switching to EMACS (of which I'm using to edit this README).
