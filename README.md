## About me

Hi, my nickname is April and I am a _Brazilian_ 20 year old self-taught developer. I am currently a Electronic/Software Engineering major at [Universidade de Brasília](https://www.unb.br).

My programming language of choice is C/C++, of which I have been using for the last
4 years. I'm also somewhat experienced at other languages such as Typescript and Javascript, Java and Lua. And I'm currently learning VHDL, PDDL and HDDL as they're required for my classes, and Rust in my free time. 

I have a huge soft spot for low level and high performance programming. Basically anything that requires me to work closely to the hardware.

I am proficient in the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm and I'm currently deepening my skills on Data Structures and other important algorithms.

I like to direct most of my work towards helping other developers and to provide well-documented, open-source code for other users so I can not only improve my own skills but also help others learn.

I often prefer to work alone or at least separately. I can, however, efficiently develop while being part of a team. My greatest strength is being sociable and always trying to create a positive work environment for those around me.

I'm quite familiar with the Git workflow, which allows me to swiftly work in a development team and/or on large codebases.

I've also been voluntarily teaching basic computer algorithms and programming logic in C to other students at my university.

I am proficient in the English language - scale C2 obtained through the CAE exam from the University of Cambridge. I have always been very fond of learning new languages, not only in the realm of programming. I currently speak Portuguese and English, and I'm on the process of learning Swedish and German.

## My system

I run Windows 11 on my main computer, alongside a heavily customized Microsoft Terminal installation of which I hold dear to my heart. On my notebook, I run Fedora with the i3 desktop environment for maximum productivity.

My editor of choice is _Visual Studio Code_, however I often switch to softwares from Jetbrains, such as CLion and Intellij IDEA, whenever I'm working on a larger project.

I'm a big fan of modal editors in general, so I'll use VIM emulators everywhere I can.
