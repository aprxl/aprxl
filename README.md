## About me
Hi, my name is April and I am a Brazilian 18 year old junior, self-taught developer. I am currently a Software Engineering major at [Universidade de Bras√≠lia](https://www.unb.br).

My main language is Typescript/Javascript (*node.js*) and I'm currently focusing in developing my web development skills with **React** and learning other JS frameworks such as Vue and Angular.

I like to direct my work towards helping other developers and to provide well-documented, open-source code for other users so I can not only improve my own work but also help others learn.

## My system
I'm currently running Windows 11 w/ an optional ArchLinux dual boot on both my systems. I use the *Windows Terminal* with a custom *Powershell* installation that I spend most of my day on.

My main code editor is *Visual Studio Code* with *VIM* keybinds for better productivity, although I've been considering fully switching to EMACS (of which I'm using to edit this README).

## Repositories
- **[scripting](https://github.com/aprxl/scripting)**: All of my work directed towards game scripting/exploiting.
