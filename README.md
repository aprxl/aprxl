# About me

Hello, my name is April and I am an 17 year old male amateur programmer. Most of my work is directed towards game cheating, in the form of extensions (aka "scripts") for 
cheating softwares such as Onetap, Gamesense, Aimware and others. My current main language is Javascript, although I can also program in C/C++, Java and Lua.
